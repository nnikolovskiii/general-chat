# AI-Powered Task Management Agent

## Overview
A voice-first, AI-driven virtual assistant that automates task, project, and goal management.  
It behaves like a personalized operating system, offering both voice and text interaction.

## Key Features
1. **Voice & Text Input**  
   - Primary: voice commands  
   - Fallback: text input  

2. **Automated Task Management**  
   - Creates / updates / deletes tasks automatically  
   - Extracts and stores relevant information  

3. **Personalized File System**  
   - Dedicated virtual workspace under `/home/nnikolovskii/info`  
   - Tracks tasks, projects, and long-term goals in a unified structure  

4. **Smart Assistance**  
   - Natural-language understanding  
   - Learns user behavior for proactive management  

## Goals
- Eliminate manual task management  
- Save time and improve productivity through AI automation

### **AI Task & Project Management Agent**  

#### **Overview**  
The project is an AI-powered agent designed to manage tasks, projects, and goals efficiently. It provides a structured way to organize workflows while allowing intuitive voice-based interaction for quick input.  

#### **Key Features**  
1. **Task & Project Management**  
   - Creates and tracks tasks, goals, and project overviews.  
   - Organizes each project in a dedicated folder within a structured file system.  

2. **Voice-Based Interaction**  
   - Users can describe tasks or commands via voice input, enabling faster and more natural communication than text.  
   - Ideal for handling large amounts of information efficiently.  

3. **File System & Tool Integration**  
   - Operates within a mini file-based "operating system" where it:  
     - Navigates, reads, and writes files.  
     - Executes commands as needed.  
   - Users can later review or extract data from this file system.  

4. **Modular & Extensible Design**  
   - Currently runs in Docker containers for easy deployment.  
   - No dedicated UI yet, but open for customization (e.g., integrating other interfaces).  
   - Currently linked to Telegram for voice input during testing.  

#### **Current Stage & Future Potential**  
- In **testing phase**, with Telegram serving as the primary input method.  
- Designed for reusability—others can adapt the Docker setup or build their own UI.  
- Potential expansions:  
  - Custom dashboards or integrations (e.g., Slack, web apps).  
  - Enhanced automation features (e.g., AI-driven prioritization).  

#### **Why Voice Input?**  
- Speed: Describing complex tasks verbally is faster than typing.  
- Scalability: Handles large inputs more effectively than text-based methods.  

---  

Project structure:
Each project managed by the AI agent follows a standardized file structure to organize tasks, progress, and goals. Here's how it works:  

#### Core Project Files  
1. **tasks.md** – Contains active tasks (new, in-progress, or pending modifications).  
2. **finished_task.md** – Stores completed tasks (moved from tasks.md when marked as done).  
3. **details.md** – Holds project descriptions, summaries, and updates.  
4. **goals.md** – Tracks high-level objectives and how tasks align with them.

#### How the AI Agent Handles Requests  
- **New/modified tasks** → Updated in tasks.md.  
- **Completed tasks** → Moved to finished_task.md.  
- **Project overview updates** → Edited in details.md.  
- **Goal-related changes** → Reflected in goals.md.
