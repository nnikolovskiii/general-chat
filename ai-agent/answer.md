Key features of the AI Task & Project Management Agent:

1. **Voice-first interaction** – Accepts voice commands as the primary input (with text as fallback) for fast, natural task entry.
2. **Automated task management** – Creates, updates, deletes, and tracks tasks, projects, and goals without manual effort.
3. **Personalized file-system workspace** – Maintains a dedicated, structured folder tree (`/home/nnikolovskii/info`) that stores tasks.md, finished_task.md, details.md, and goals.md for every project.
4. **Smart assistance & learning** – Uses natural-language understanding and learns user behavior to proactively manage and prioritize work.
5. **Modular, extensible design** – Runs in Docker, currently Telegram-linked for voice input, and can be customized with other UIs or integrations (e.g., Slack, web dashboards).
6. **Unified project structure** – Each project follows a consistent file layout so the agent (and users) can always locate tasks, progress, and objectives.
